## 1.Purpose statement:  
  - Purpose of the application is to create an online environment where students in group projects or other group related activities can post tasks and necessary updates for their peers to see. Intended audience would be college students at USF.


## 2.Overview: 
  - This system requirements specification will go over that general functionality of the proposed application. It will highlight functions that will be implemented and other items that the application will aim to achieve. It will then review coding frameworks and languages that will be used and coding standards that the application will follow.


## 3.Product perspective: 
  - This application would be similar to the application Locket. Where students would be able to add users to a group and then create task related post to the group for others to see. These posts would be visible to everyone in the group and would keep others updated about the statues of the group.

## 6.List of defined terms (specialized words & phrases, abbreviations)
  - This section is empty.
## 7.List of references (documents references in SRS and their sources)
  - This section is empty.
## 8.List of end-user characteristics (education, experience, technical expertise)
  - a. College students
  - b. Education level is typically a high school diploma working towards a bachelors degree
  - c. Users would be expected to have some technical experience before using our application. Students are experienced with technology such as Canvas and other online resources which would be enough knowledge to have before using our application.
## 9.List of constraints (operational & technical)
  - Economic Constraint: Hosting the website on a server would cost money which is not within our current budget.
  - Time constraint: Team members are not full-time invested in the project, due to other duties, therefore time can be a constraint.
    
## 10. List of standards (e.g., programming language, coding standards
  - a.This system must be developed using programming languages that are compatible with the Ruby on Rails [https://rubystyle.guide/] framework and it would follow coding standards set by the Ruby Style Guide. The system should also follow user-interface standards associated with modern web-based software systems

## 11.   List of assumptions (e.g., hardware/software platform targeted)
  - a.This software will run on web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
